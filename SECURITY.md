# ðŸ”’ Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the CodeKatas API to protect against malicious actors and ensure proper data access control.

## Authentication & Authorization

### âœ… Protected Routes (Require Authentication)

All API routes except webhooks require valid Clerk authentication:

- **`/api/problems`** - GET - List problems (authenticated users only)
- **`/api/problems/[id]`** - GET - Get specific problem (authenticated users only)
- **`/api/attempts`** - POST/GET - Create/fetch attempt sessions (user's own data only)
- **`/api/attempts/[sessionId]`** - PUT/GET - Update/fetch session details (user's own sessions only)
- **`/api/user/stats`** - GET - Get user statistics (user's own data only)
- **`/api/user/attempts`** - GET - Get user's attempt history (user's own data only)

### âœ… Public Routes (Properly Secured)

- **`/api/webhooks/clerk`** - POST - Clerk webhook endpoint (signature verification required)

## Input Validation & Sanitization

### UUID Validation

All UUID parameters are validated using regex to prevent injection attacks:

```typescript
const uuidRegex =
  /^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[1-5][0-9a-f]{3}-[89ab][0-9a-f]{3}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i;
```

### Numeric Input Validation

All numeric inputs are validated with appropriate ranges:

- **Session Duration**: 0-3600 seconds (max 1 hour)
- **Accuracy**: 0-100%
- **Characters Per Minute**: 0-1000 CPM
- **Pagination Limits**: Capped at reasonable values (50-100 items)

### Request Size Limits

- **Pagination**: Limited to prevent large data dumps
- **Keystroke Events**: Validated array structure
- **Session Duration**: Capped at 1 hour maximum

## Authorization Controls

### User Data Isolation

- Users can only access their own attempt sessions
- Users can only update sessions they created
- User statistics are isolated per user
- All queries include `user_id` filters

### Session Ownership Verification

Before updating or accessing sessions, the API verifies:

```typescript
const sessionResult = await db.query(
  "SELECT id FROM attempt_sessions WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2",
  [sessionId, dbUserId]
);
```

## Webhook Security

### Signature Verification

Clerk webhooks are secured using Svix signature verification:

- Validates `svix-id`, `svix-timestamp`, and `svix-signature` headers
- Uses `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for signature validation
- Rejects requests with invalid signatures

## Error Handling

### Secure Error Messages

- Generic error messages prevent information leakage
- No sensitive data exposed in error responses
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error types

### Input Sanitization

- All user inputs are validated before database queries
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through proper data handling

## Database Security

### Parameterized Queries

All database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection:

```typescript
await db.query("SELECT * FROM problems WHERE id = $1 AND language = $2", [
  id,
  "javascript",
]);
```

### User Context in Queries

All user-specific queries include user ID filtering:

```typescript
WHERE user_id = $1 AND session_id = $2
```

## Rate Limiting Considerations

While not implemented in this version, consider adding:

- Request rate limiting per user
- IP-based rate limiting
- Burst protection for API endpoints

## Security Headers

Recommended headers to add in production:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

## Environment Variables

Required secure environment variables:

- `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For webhook signature verification
- `DATABASE_URL` - Encrypted database connection
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Public Clerk key
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Private Clerk key (server-side only)

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Event Logging

- Failed authentication attempts
- Invalid UUID format requests
- Webhook signature verification failures
- Unauthorized access attempts

### Audit Trail

- All user actions are logged with timestamps
- Session creation and completion events
- User progress updates

## Testing Security

### Recommended Security Tests

1. **Authentication Tests**

   - Verify unauthenticated requests are rejected
   - Test with invalid/malformed tokens

2. **Authorization Tests**

   - Verify users cannot access other users' data
   - Test session ownership validation

3. **Input Validation Tests**

   - Test with malformed UUIDs
   - Test with out-of-range numeric values
   - Test with oversized payloads

4. **Webhook Security Tests**
   - Test with invalid signatures
   - Test with missing headers
   - Test with malformed payloads

## Deployment Security

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables properly set
- [ ] Database connection encrypted
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak information
- [ ] Logging configured for security events
- [ ] Regular security updates applied

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure

1. **Immediate Response**

   - Block malicious IPs if identified
   - Review logs for attack patterns
   - Notify security team

2. **Investigation**

   - Analyze attack vectors
   - Assess data exposure
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**

   - Apply patches/fixes
   - Update security measures
   - Monitor for repeat attacks

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Update security documentation
   - Improve monitoring
   - Conduct security review
